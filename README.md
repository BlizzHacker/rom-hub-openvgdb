# OpenVGDB plugin for ROM Hub

A project of the [Move Weight Foundation](https://foundation.moveweight.com), an
Oklahoma non-profit corporation with 501(c)(3) status pending.

Implements the RPP v1 `metadata` capability: proposes a **curated title** and a
cover for a ROM already in your library, from the
[Open Video Game Database](https://github.com/OpenVGDB/OpenVGDB) — a freely
redistributable SQLite database of 51,742 ROMs and 53,871 releases across 43
systems.

| Capability | Source | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata` | `openvgdb.sqlite`, fetched and verified by the Hub | proposes `name` from `RELEASES.releaseTitleName`, and `artwork_url` from `releaseCoverFront` |

**No API key**, and no account. The database is a file — declared in the manifest, fetched and hash-verified by the Hub, and cached once.

## Install

    rom-hub plugin install ./plugins-dev/openvgdb
    rom-hub enrich openvgdb 42

That is the whole setup. The database is a **declared data asset**: the
manifest names the release, its size and the sha256 of the unpacked
`openvgdb.sqlite`, and the Hub fetches it the first time the plugin is used,
verifies it, and caches it under `$ROM_HUB_HOME/var/plugin-data/openvgdb/`.
Every later run re-verifies that cached copy and fetches nothing.

The download is **announced twice** before it ever happens — once by
`plugin install`, which prints the size, the origin and the digest, and again
on stderr immediately before the request:

    note: openvgdb: fetching data asset 'openvgdb.sqlite' -- 8.7 MiB from
      https://github.com/OpenVGDB/OpenVGDB/releases/download/v29.0/openvgdb.zip
      (sha256 a6df8311ff18...). It is verified on arrival and cached [...]

If you would rather it did not happen on its own:

    ROM_HUB_NO_ASSET_FETCH=1 rom-hub enrich openvgdb 42   # refuses, says how
    rom-hub plugin assets openvgdb                        # what it wants, and whether it has it
    rom-hub plugin assets openvgdb --fetch                # get it now, deliberately

## Config

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db_path` | `str` | `""` | a copy of `openvgdb.sqlite` to use **instead** of the fetched one. Optional |
| `artwork` | `bool` | `true` | propose a cover as well as a title |
| `set_name` | `bool` | `true` | propose OpenVGDB's title |
| `region` | `str` | `""` | prefer this region's release (`USA`, `Europe`, `Japan`, `World`, …) |

`db_path` is an **override, not a fallback**: when it is set it wins outright.
An operator who pinned a specific copy — an older release, a file on a NAS,
one shared with OpenEmu, one they audited themselves — has said something
more specific than the manifest's default, and being quietly overruled by a
cache is not what they asked for. It is simply no longer *required*.

    curl -LO https://github.com/OpenVGDB/OpenVGDB/releases/download/v29.0/openvgdb.zip
    unzip openvgdb.zip     # 9,118,645 bytes in, a 40.3 MiB openvgdb.sqlite out

## Why the plugin still cannot fetch this itself

It cannot, and nothing here pretends otherwise — what changed is that it no
longer has to. Four host facts, each independent and each still true:

1. **Size.** `openvgdb.zip` is 9,118,645 bytes. `ctx.http` refuses any response
   over `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`, which is 4 MiB, and it refuses it on
   `Content-Length` before a byte of body is pulled.
2. **Encoding.** `HttpResponse` carries `text`, decoded with
   `errors="replace"`. There is no byte channel. A ZIP that somehow fit under
   the cap would arrive irrecoverably mangled.
3. **Redirects.** The asset is served from
   `github.com/OpenVGDB/OpenVGDB/releases/download/v29.0/openvgdb.zip`, which
   answers `302` to `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` (checked
   2026-07-29 — note that is no longer `objects.githubusercontent.com`). The
   host fetcher runs `follow_redirects=False` deliberately, so a redirect
   cannot escape an allowlist, and `HttpResponse` exposes no headers. A plugin
   sees `302` and cannot learn where to.
4. **Nowhere to cache it.** A plugin subprocess is started per command and dies
   with it, so "download it once and cache it" had no storage to use.

So the **host** does all four things instead, and the plugin declares what it
wants rather than asking at runtime:

- the size cap is a separate, larger, explicit 128 MiB budget that applies to
  assets only — `ctx.http`'s 4 MiB is untouched, because that body is
  buffered in memory and JSON-escaped into a reply frame, which an asset never
  is;
- the bytes land on disk and the plugin is handed a **path**, so nothing
  crosses the JSON channel and SQLite can mmap the file properly;
- the 302 is followed but **re-validated hop by hop** against this plugin's own
  allowlist, which is why `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` appears in it
  — an undeclared hop ends the download;
- and the cache is the Hub's, under `$ROM_HUB_HOME/var/`, never this plugin's
  directory (which the registry deletes and replaces on every reinstall).

**The digest is the part that matters most.** A 9 MB blob off the network,
feeding the names and covers written into your library, is a supply chain. The
Hub verifies `openvgdb.sqlite` against the sha256 in this manifest *before*
telling the plugin where it is, refuses on mismatch without caching anything,
and re-verifies the cached copy on every later run rather than trusting that
it is still the file it fetched.

**On GitHub's robots.txt.** `github.com/robots.txt` carries
`Disallow: /*/download` for `User-agent: *`, and that pattern does cover a
release-asset path. It is worth saying plainly rather than leaving unmentioned,
because this plugin refuses `art.gametdb.com` covers on exactly those grounds.
The two are not the same act. `art.gametdb.com` serves `Disallow: *.*` —
everything, unconditionally — and proposing covers from it would mean
programmatically harvesting many URLs across a site, which is crawling.
This is one fetch, of one artefact, named in advance in a manifest a human
approved, triggered by an operator running a command, announced before it
happens, and cached so it happens once: the same request the `curl -LO` line
above makes, moved from your shell into the Hub. Nothing is discovered, nothing
is traversed, and nothing recurs. If you disagree with that reading,
`ROM_HUB_NO_ASSET_FETCH=1` plus `db_path` is the arrangement this plugin
shipped with and it still works exactly as before.

**And there is nothing to query instead.** OpenVGDB publishes no API. Its
repository holds a `.gitignore` and a 28-byte `README.md`; the entire project
is one release asset, last published 2021-11-11. There is no endpoint to ask.

The file is opened **read-only** through a `file:...?mode=ro` URI. That is not
decoration, and it now has three reasons rather than two: `sqlite3.connect` on
a plain path *creates* an empty database when the path does not exist, so a
typo in `db_path` would otherwise give a valid connection to a zero-table file
and a stream of "no match" answers that look like real data; it guarantees this
plugin never writes to a database you may be sharing with OpenEmu; and when the
file is the Hub's cached data asset, a plugin that wrote so much as a journal
into it would fail the integrity check on the very next run.

## How a ROM is matched

In order, and every one of them is scoped to a single system:

1. **`--source-id`**, read as a hash if it is 8, 32 or 40 hex characters
   (CRC-32, MD5, SHA-1 — OpenVGDB carries no SHA-256), otherwise as a
   cartridge/disc **serial**.
2. **A hash from `RomRef.extra`** (`sha1`, `md5`, `crc`), if a host supplied one.
3. **The filename**, matched **exactly**, ignoring case and extension. Exact,
   never fuzzy and never a prefix: `Tetris` will not pick up `Tetris 2`.

Two ROMs matching means the plugin **refuses and names both** rather than
choosing. Where one ROM has several regional releases, the region your own
filename mentions wins, then World / USA / Europe / Japan, then the lowest
release id, so the choice is stable across runs.

    rom-hub enrich openvgdb 42 --source-id 74591cc9501af93873f9a5d3eb12da12c0723bbc
    rom-hub enrich openvgdb 42 --source-id GW7D69      # a disc serial

## What it sets

- **`name`** — `RELEASES.releaseTitleName`. This is the point of the plugin.
  OpenVGDB is the only source in this directory carrying a *curated title*
  rather than a dump name: the Game Boy ROM it files as
  `Tetris (World) (Rev A).gb` is titled **`Tetris`**. That is the distinction
  `libretro-thumbnails` refused to blur when it declined to write a No-Intro
  filename into a library as a game name, and it is why this plugin may write
  one where that plugin may not.
- **`artwork_url`** — `releaseCoverFront`, or `releaseCoverBack` if the front
  is unusable. The **host** fetches it, after checking it against this
  plugin's allowlist.

**No provider ids.** OpenVGDB carries no IGDB, MobyGames or ScreenScraper
identifier. Its own `romID` and `releaseID` are row numbers in a file you
downloaded — meaningful to nothing else — and RomM has no field that means
"a row in somebody's local SQLite". An id written there would look like a
cross-reference and be a coincidence.

Everything else is left **absent**, which `MetadataPatch` defines as "leave
RomM alone".

## Artwork, and the host that is missing from the allowlist

Cover URLs in OpenVGDB point at three hosts, and this plugin declares two of them for covers (its other two allowlist entries are for the database download and are never proposed as a cover):

| Host | Covers | Declared |
|---|---|---|
| `gamefaqs.gamespot.com` | 31,235 | yes |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` | 10,777 (all arcade) | yes |
| `art.gametdb.com` | 1,789 (GameCube, Wii) | **no** |

`art.gametdb.com` serves a `robots.txt` of `User-agent: *` / `Disallow: *.*`.
So those covers are never probed and never proposed, and GameCube and Wii ROMs
get a title and no cover. Working around that would mean ignoring a directive
the site went to the trouble of publishing.

`gamefaqs.gamespot.com` allows `User-agent: *` with `Allow: /` (it disallows a
list of named AI crawlers, of which the Hub is not one).
`raw.githubusercontent.com` serves no `robots.txt` at all (HTTP 404,
2026-07-29), so there is no directive to observe.

**Expect no cover from GameFAQs in practice.** Measured on 2026-07-29, from a
residential connection, with the Hub's own user agent
(`rom-hub/0.1 (+https://github.com/rommapp/romm)`):

    403   https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/a/box/2/8/2/22282_front.jpg
    200   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clobber/arcade-titles/master/005.png

GameFAQs sits behind Cloudflare and answers `403` with an interstitial to a
non-browser client. Robots *permits* the fetch; the site declines to serve it,
which is a different thing and not one to work around. The host is left in the
allowlist because the refusal is not universal — a different network or a
future policy may serve it — and because the probe makes being wrong free:
you get the title and no cover, rather than a failed enrich. In practice that
means **arcade ROMs get covers and most others get titles only.**

**A candidate is probed before it is proposed.** `MetadataPatch` has no way to
say "try this URL, never mind if it fails", and the host treats a failed
artwork fetch as a failed enrich — so a 403 on an image would throw away a
title that was already correct. The plugin GETs the cover first and proposes it
only on a `200`. The cost is that a hit is fetched twice, once to confirm and
once by the host to keep. The benefit is that artwork is the optional half of
this patch and behaves like it.

Redirects count as a miss, because `ctx.http` does not follow one and exposes
no `Location`: a cover that has moved is a cover this plugin cannot name.

## Platforms

`openvgdb/platforms.py` maps RomM platform slugs to `SYSTEMS.systemID`. It is
an exact-match lookup with **no fallback**: an unmapped slug raises
**"needs mapping"** and names itself.

The scoping is not a nicety. OpenVGDB is one flat `ROMs` table and `Tetris` is
not the only `Tetris` in it; an unscoped filename lookup would happily return
another console's game. The values are read from the database itself (43 rows
in `SYSTEMS`); the keys are RomM slugs from the set `libretro-thumbnails`
verified against RomM 4.9.2's `GET /api/platforms/supported`.

Most of RomM's platforms are simply **absent**, and that is the data's fault
rather than the table's: OpenVGDB was built for OpenEmu's console list and
stopped being updated in 2021. There is no DOS, no Amiga, no ZX Spectrum, no
PlayStation 2, and nothing later than the PSP.

## Terms and licensing, in plain language

OpenVGDB is published as a public GitHub release and is redistributed by a long
list of emulator frontends — OpenEmu, Provenance and others bundle or download
it — but **the repository declares no licence file and GitHub reports no
licence for it**. So "freely redistributable in practice" is an accurate
description of how the project is used and distributed, and "licensed for
redistribution" is not a claim this plugin is in a position to make for you.
This plugin bundles none of it: you download the file yourself, from the
project, and it stays on your disk.

The *contents* are two different things with two different positions. The hash
and filename tables are catalogue facts about dumps. The cover images are not
in the database at all — it stores **URLs** to third-party sites, and the
artwork at the other end is the publishers' copyright, hosted by GameFAQs and
by community projects rather than licensed to you. Fetching one to illustrate
your own library is what the database is for; republishing a library built this
way is your call to make, and not one this plugin can make for you.

This plugin's own code is MIT (see `LICENSE`). It bundles no data and no
artwork.

## Notes

The plugin opens no sockets — `ctx.http` is an RPC back to the Hub, which
checks every URL against the declared allowlist before fetching. Reading the
SQLite file is an ordinary file read; RPP v1's confinement closes network
egress and process spawn, and does not (and cannot, with seccomp alone) filter
file paths.

Every query is a full table scan: `SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE
type='index'` returns nothing on release v29.0, so the database ships with no
indexes at all. Over 51,742 rows that is a few milliseconds, and adding an
index would mean writing to a file you may be sharing with another program.

## Seen working

The cover art and titles in this library were written by metadata plugins like this one. Where a tile still shows a placeholder, no art database carried that game — homebrew and interactive fiction mostly are not in one.
